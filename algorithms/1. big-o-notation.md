- A notation that tells us how fast an algortihm is.
- It's a measures the fastness of algorithm in terms of operations (not in seconds).
- Big O denotes worst case run time.

Big O notation: O(n) -> Here _n_ stands for the number of  operations.

## Example

| O(n)       | Simple search             |
| O(n.log n) | Quick Sort                |
| O(n2)      | Selection sort            |
