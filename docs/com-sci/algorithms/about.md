## Why Reading this book?

This book is part of many blog posts and YouTube videos, and it is praised for the manner in which it teaches algorithms. 


I've been in the industry for a decade now. Fortunately or unfortunately, I was able to survive without understanding the various algorithms that are deemed must-know for software engineers. Algorithms are not only for software engineers, and being a data engineer is not a valid reason to skip learning them. They say it's better late than never, so now I've started learning them.
